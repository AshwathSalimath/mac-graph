### Station Properties

This is the first (easy) question I've got working. Here's a log of known working configurations:

- Commit <kb>85b98a3</kb>
	- `python -m mac-graph.train --input-dir input_data/processed/stationProp_tiny_50k_12th --model-dir output/model_sp_85b98a3_v512 --kb-edge-width 7 --disable-data-stack --disable-kb-edge --vocab-size 512 --answer-classes 512`
	- 90% accuracy after 10k training steps

- Commit <kb>5eef6f0</kb>
	- Added kb_edges and data_stack
	- `python -m mac-graph.train --input-dir input_data/processed/stationProp_tiny_50k_12th`
	- 80% acc after 6k steps


- Commit <kb>da4b306</kb>
	- Adding residual connections increased accuracy 25%, achieving 100% after 10k steps
