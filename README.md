# MacGraph with Population-based Training

The Population-based training code is imported from [Genetic Curriculum](https://github.com/Octavian-ai/genetic-curriculum) experiment conducted at [Octavian.AI](https://www.octavian.ai). The idea of [Population-based training](https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.09846) originates from [DeepMind](https://deepmind.com).

The core codebase implements graph question answering (GQA), using [CLEVR-graph](https://github.com/Octavian-ai/clevr-graph) as the dataset and [MACnets](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.03067) as the reasoning architecture.

## Project status

*Apologies that the training data isn't available - I've yet to find a quick solution to this, when I get the system working on more questions I'll publish a stable "all question" dataset with 1M items. For now, you can easily build you own data - ask David for help.*

For more in-depth information about what works/doesn't work, check out the [experiment log](log.md).

## Running the code

See [RUNNING.md](RUNNING.md) for how to both run the network and also use a cluster to optimize its hyper-parameters.

The short summary of how to train locally:
```
$ pipenv install
$ pipenv shell
(mac-graph-sjOzWQ6Y) $ python -m macgraph.train
```

### Acknowledgments

Thanks to Drew Hudson and Christopher Manning for publishing their work, [Compositional Attention Networks for Machine Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.03067) upon which this is based. Thanks also to DeepMind for publishing their Differentiable Neural Computer results in Nature with a demonstration of that architecture solving graph problems, it is a reassurance that this endeavor is not ill-founded.
